- What is this?

This is my attempt at porting NetBSD sed to Linux.

With my little-to-zero knowledge of C, I hope I made at least 
mistakes as possible, so I wouldn't have to fix them (because I can't).

- Why?

I didn't like how heavy GNU sed is.

NetBSD sed's '-i' behaves just like the GNU version, but it's a lot smaller.

- How do I use this?

Just type `make`. To install, `make install`. To uninstall, `make uninstall`.

It should work fine with most implementations, though personally I have only
tested it with GNU make and bmake.
