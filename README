- What is this?

This is my attempt at porting NetBSD sed to Linux.

With my little-to-zero knowledge of C, I hope I made at least 
mistakes as possible, so I wouldn't have to fix them (because I can't).

- Why?

I didn't like how heavy GNU sed is.

NetBSD sed's '-i' behaves just like the GNU version, but it's a lot smaller.

- How do I use this?

Just type `make`. To install, `make install`. To uninstall, `make uninstall`.

It should work fine on most implementations, though personally I have only
tested it with GNU make and bmake.

There are some variables you probably should look at:
	+ CC 	 - default C compiler to use 		- defaults to `cc`.
	+ PREFIX - install prefix 			- defaults to /usr/local
	+ BINDIR - binary (sed) install location 	- defaults to ${PREFIX}/bin
	+ MANDIR - manpage (sed.1) install location 	- defaults to ${PREFIX}/share/man
